# Hello! Should we prompt?

I've been a builder üçÄ all my life making systems that work for enterprise, production loads. 

An arc of 'AI' is exchange of information within context to create value. As product, that means I get to work on something which solves an experience problem, or a business problem, or both, because someone is willing to pay for that solution. Let me be succinct:  So far, no one is paying me for this. Since it produces delight in me, perhaps it is art?

The project has four systems:

1. A code generation model.
2. A chat history summarization model.
3. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model.
4. A Diffusion generator.

### About:  
- I work in the intersections of infrastructure, performance, and revenue.  
- I am deeply curious about LLM systems which assist people to solve for accuracy, speed, utility, and delight. 
- I am working on enterprise LLMs with traceability to the original factual source. 
- We augment open source LLMs with domain-specific and proprietary data for contextual relevance. 
- We write software which we ourselves, use... 

### Project Overview:
* App code is a simple Go web server 
* The app is containerized into a Docker image called `bedrock-k` 
* The Dockerfile uses a Go builder image to compile the app code and copies the binary into a minimal final image
* The app can be manually deployed using flyctl from the fly.toml config file
* GitHub Actions deploys main to dev automatically

### Tech stack:
* Python - for well, everything
* Parcel - for preprocessing SCSS and JS bundling
* Go - for the app code
* Docker - for unit of deployment
* flyctl - for manual deployment
* GitHub Actions - for CI/CD
* Fly.io - for the serverless hosting platform

```flyctl``` is a CLI tool from [Fly.io](http://fly.io)
You can read about it [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/).
